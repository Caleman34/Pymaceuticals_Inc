1. Tumors for mice that were treated with Capomulin and Ramicane have the smallest tumor volumes than the other drug regimens.  Katapril had the highest tumor volume, indicating ti was not very effective.
2. There is a correlation between the weight of the mouse and the volume fo the tumor.  The more a mouse weighs, the larger volume the tumor is.
3. There was an equal number of male vs. female mice in the study.  more data will be neeed to determine if the reults are the same between males and females for each drug regimen.  Some drugs that may appear not as effective in reducing tumorsize, may be more effective for one gender than the other, thus skewing the results.
